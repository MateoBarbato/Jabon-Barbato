## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:


- [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
- [Gulp] - the streaming build system
- [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML
to Markdown converter
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

## Downloading Files

Jaboon requires [React](https://reactjs.org) v8^+ to run.

First Download the repository from Github link or
Clone the repository on your desired folder
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MateoBarbato/Jabon-Barbato
```

## Install the dependencies and start the server.
First check that you are in the proyect folder with ```.ls``` on the console, then do this:

```sh
npm install --save
npm start
```

Once you do this it will automatically open a window in your default browser with the proyect in it.

By default it runs in ```localhost:4000``` but you can change it depending of your preference following this steps  or reading this [tutorial](https://devdojo.com/howtoubuntu/how-to-change-reactjs-localhost-port):

- First look for the package.json file in your proyect folder

- Once located search the script property of script of the json file

- Depending on what launching method you are using you can add ```set PORT==DESIREDPORTNUMBER``` followed by ```&&```
and then the react launching method
>Example : `set PORT==3002 && react-scripts start`
- Also if you check the console when you run the proyect it will dispay 2 messages, one saying that is running on localhost:PORT and a second message saying that is running on your network saying [YOUR IP ADDRES:PORT] something like this:
>Example :  `196.69.1.1:3000`
